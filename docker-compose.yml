# DEBUGGING TIPS: 
# NOTE: The IP Adress we need to use to connect to our postgresql server is changed; It's no longer local host (127.0.0.1)
#       To find the IP-adress you can enter the following commands:  
# Get the name of the network both services (postgres and exercise.wwwapi) is connected to, it will have something to do with our network name `my_first_network`: 
#       docker network ls
#
# This should return a list of all networks; identify yours. To see which containers is connected along with the IP-addresses you can run this command: 
#       
#  $ docker inspect dockercompose10790856979179560925_my_first_network2
# 
# The result will show each containers along with their local ip; Select the local ip for the postgresql container, and use it in the connection string in appsettings.json

# NOTE 2: be careful what subnet and ipv4 addresses you pick for the services and network... Don't pick one that is already busy...

# NOTE 3: If you get `Resources cannnot be shared`, check the `Output` tab for more information that's most likely not the real issue...
